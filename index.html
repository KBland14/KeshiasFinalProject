    <p>About 2 years ago, I started my journey into Resin. At first it was a rough experenices, mostly because I had no clue what i was doing. It was an experenices to say the least.</p>
    <p> After messing up a few times and searching for more information I found a group on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/770399384890305">Resin for beginners.</a> This group is super nice and supportive for all beginners and saved me from alot of headaches. Plus it gave me different ideas, and now im createing my own works and adding different mediums to my work.</p>
