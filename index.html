    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a United States Marine who separated in 2011, and I currently work overnight shifts in a hospital setting. Outside of my professional life, I’ve built a steady creative practice that includes resin and plaster resin work, paracord projects, diamond art, detailed LEGO builds, wood pieces, and color-by-number. Crafting gives me a focused, structured outlet where I can apply patience, precision, and problem solving in a different way. This website documents that ongoing journey and the projects that continue to shape my skills and perspective.</p>

    <h2>My Crafts</h2>
    <p>I am currently taking a break from my crafting, to take a few classes. But I do plan on starting back up here in the near future. Crafting helps me to relax and use my mind to figure out how to get the idea in my head and make it visual. In the past I have worked mostly with resin and different paracord projects. I have done a few diamond-art posters, a few projects with wood and I started a big LEGO build. This site is going to focus mainly on <a href="Resin.html">Resin</a>. I also am going to talk about some of the other crafts (<a href="Mixedmedia.html">Mixed Media</a>). I do hope you enjoy the site, and maybe you will try some of them yourself.
