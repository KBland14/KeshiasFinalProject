    <div class="picgrid" id="evenpics">
      <p><img src="images/BlueGreenDragon.jpeg" alt="a dragon mixed with blue and green next to a set of unfinished dominos" width="100"> I used 2 different resin colors to make this dragon. It's one of the more basic projects I have done.</p>

      <p><img src="images/Dominos.jpeg" alt="Orange Set of Dominos with white dots" width="100"> These dominos were done at the same time with a single pour. As you can see even though i poured them at theh same time, you still can't find 2 that look exactly alike.</p>

      <p><img src="images/GiDMouse.jpeg" alt="a Mickey Mouse Face that glows" width="100"> I used glow in the dark fish tank stones to make this Mickey Mouse face glow. I also used a light green tint in the resin, even though you cant tell.</p>

      <p><img src="images/LeafEgg.jpeg" alt="A clear egg with 2 leaves inside" width="100"> I used UV Resin to make the 2 leaves, then added them to the egg. As you can see its not perfect (it does have a few bubbles) and that’s okay.</p>

      <p><img src="images/LetterP.jpeg" alt="A Pink Letter P" width="100">  This is another UV Resin Project. As you can see I used a darker color and because of that a few weeks after making this, it started to leak. </p>

      <p><img src="images/SkullAshtray.jpeg" alt="A skull ashtray with red eyes and mouth" width="100"> This ashtray was made with regular resin, but I did use the UV to fill in the mouth and eyes. I used an alcohol marker to color them red and then sealed it with a coat of regular Resin</p>

      <p><img src="images/SkullBox.jpeg" alt="A box with a skull stenciled on the lid" width="100"> I used a stencil and mica powder to put the design directly on the lid mold. After that I used regular resin to fill it in. </p>

      <p><img src="images/SkullContainers.jpeg" alt="Containers shaped like skulls" width="100"> These No Evil containers were done by brushing the mica powder onto the mold itself. I did use a dark color mica to finish the pour</p>

      <p><img src="images/Skulls.jpeg" alt="Tiny Skulls in different colors" width="100"> These mini skulls were made using an ice cube tray mold. I chose the colors at random</p>

      <p><img src="images/2Bracelet.jpeg" alt="2 Bracelets with stitch pattern" width="100"> These 2 bracelets were done with a basic design and i added the stitch pattern on once I finished. The white and Black one has a key attached to the middle.</p>

      <p><img src="images/3ColorBracelet.jpeg" alt="A Red Green and Yellow Bracelet " width="100"> A 3 color bracelet with black on the outside and red green and yellow in the middle.</p>


      <p> <img src="images/BlueAndGreen.jpeg" alt="A Blue and Green Bracelet with a heart in the center" width="100"> This is another basic keychain, but when I got to the center, I braided it to make it sort of resemble a heart. </p>

      <p><img src="images/Keychain.jpg" alt="A bunch of different keychains" width="100"> These are a bunch of keychains I made for the people I work with for Christmas. As you can see there are a bunch of different colors and designs. </p>

      <p> <img src="images/Halloween.jpeg" alt="Wooden Box with Wooden Halloween pieces" width="100"> I took an empty box and painted it and then took some Halloween decorations and lights and added them as well. I filled it with resin to keep everything in place, </p>

      <p> <img src="images/Rose.jpeg" alt="A Pink and Red Wooden Rose" width="100"> I took this wooden rose and painted it and then sealed the color with resin. </p>

      <p> <img src="images/WoodenItems.jpeg" alt="A Wooden Pineapple and 2 Roses painted" width="100"> These are just a few wooden items I found and colored. </p>

      <p> <img src="images/Lego.jpeg" alt="The beginning of a Lego Build" width="100">  This is the LEGO set I started on. I did not finish it just yet but its is almost complete. </p>

      <p> <img src="images/Pooh.jpeg" alt="A Color-by-Number Pic of Winnie the Pooh" width="100">This is a color-by-number picture I did for a friend who is obsessed with Pooh. I did it with an app on my tablet. </p>
      
      <p> <img src="images/Stitch.jpeg" alt="A Color-by-Number Pic of Lilo and Stitch" width="100">Another picture done on my app. This time its my favorite characters. </p>
