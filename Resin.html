    <h2>About Resin</h2>
    <p>When I first started working with resin, I didn’t know any of this. Everything I’ve shared came from hands-on experience, research, and more than a few failed projects. Resin can feel overwhelming at first, and failure is part of the process. That’s okay. Everyone makes mistakes, even crafters who have been working with resin for years.

    One of the most helpful resources I found was a Facebook group called Resin for Beginners – All Welcome, Tutorials Allowed. Members regularly share their creations and are incredibly generous with advice and answers. Even if you don’t actively participate, simply reading through the questions and responses can be extremely helpful. I also recommend scrolling through older posts. You may come across information you didn’t even realize you needed.</p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <p>Resin can be used in countless ways. As mentioned earlier, it’s commonly used to create figurines and one-of-a-kind tables, but its applications go far beyond that. Resin is often used to seal canvas paintings or applied to floors to create striking, custom designs.
    <br>
    <br>
     In my own crafting, I primarily work with molds. There is an incredible variety available, and not just molds made specifically for resin. I’ve successfully used everything from ice cube trays to candle molds, all with beautiful results. When the exact mold you need isn’t available, that’s not a limitation. Two-part silicone mold kits make it possible to create custom molds for almost any design. While I haven’t tried making my own molds yet, it’s high on my creative to-do list.</p>

    <h2>Coloring/Addins</h2>
      <p>This is my favorite part of working with resin: coloring and add-ins. Both regular resin and UV resin start out clear, which makes them a perfect canvas for creating custom colors and designs. You can add pigments to achieve almost any shade, and you can also embed objects directly into the resin.
    <br>
    <br>
      Adding objects to regular resin serves two purposes. It allows you to showcase and preserve meaningful items or images, and it can also help reduce the amount of resin needed to fill a mold, especially when you accidentally mix less resin than planned.
    <br>
    <br>
      There are several ways to color resin. Mica powder adds rich color with a shimmering effect, while alcohol ink typically produces a solid color, though it can be manipulated for more creative results. Plaster resin works a bit differently. It uses its own pigments and inks, and standard alcohol inks or mica powders don’t perform well with it. I learned that one the hard way.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>Resin is fun to work with, but like any craft, it comes with potential challenges. Being aware of these issues can help prevent frustration and improve results.
      <br>
      <br>
      Plaster resin doesn’t present many problems overall, but coloring can be tricky. It doesn’t accept color easily, and I struggled to achieve consistent results. When I finally found a method that worked, it introduced another issue: using too much pigment to reach the desired color caused it to rub off on my hands even after drying. Allowing it to cure longer didn’t resolve the problem, so I’ve stepped back from plaster resin for now while I continue researching better techniques.
      <br>
      <br>
      UV resin has its own limitations when it comes to coloring. While it accepts pigment well, the color must remain light enough for UV light to pass through and cure the resin properly. Darker colors can cause the surface to harden while the center remains liquid, which may eventually leak. Leaving the UV light on too long can also cause bubbling on the surface.
      <br>
      <br> 
      Regular resin can have more potential issues, but most are avoidable with proper research and by carefully following instructions. One of the most serious problems is known as a “flash cure.” This occurs when too much coloring is added, causing the resin to heat rapidly, sometimes even producing smoke, and harden almost instantly. I’ve experienced this a few times and was fortunate not to damage my molds. Some experienced crafters intentionally trigger this reaction for its unique visual effects, but it’s not something I’d recommend unless you have significant experience.
      <br>
      <br>
      Most other resin issues are minor and easily avoided. Mistakes happen, and each one is an opportunity to learn and improve.</p>
